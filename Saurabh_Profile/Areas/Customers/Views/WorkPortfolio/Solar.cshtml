                        The Solar Portal is an existing application aimed at providing subsidies to users who purchase solar energy systems from the state government.
                        It facilitates efficient subsidy distribution, focusing on solar installations of up to 2 kW capacity, ensuring a transparent and streamlined process.

                    <p>
                        The Solar Portal has significantly streamlined the process of providing subsidies for solar energy systems, reducing manual workload and improving transparency.
                        Its robust design and user-friendly interface have enhanced the efficiency of subsidy distribution while maintaining strict security standards.
                        This project demonstrates my expertise in ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, and front-end technologies, delivering practical solutions for large-scale applications.
