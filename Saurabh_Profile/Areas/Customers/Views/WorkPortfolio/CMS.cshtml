                    The Complaint Management System significantly streamlined the complaint handling process, reducing response times and improving user satisfaction.
                    The intuitive interface, combined with real-time updates and robust reporting, empowered both users and administrators 
                    to address complaints more effectively. This project demonstrated my expertise in ASP.NET, C#, and SQL Server,
                    along with my ability to design and implement user-centric solutions that deliver measurable results.
