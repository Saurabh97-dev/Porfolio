                        The Quarter Allotment System significantly improved the efficiency of residential quarter management.
                        By automating the application, approval, and allocation processes, it reduced manual effort and ensured a transparent and fair system.
                        The platform's user-friendly interface and robust backend architecture make it a scalable solution for organizations managing employee accommodations.
                        This project highlights my expertise in ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, and front-end development, showcasing my ability to deliver efficient and secure solutions for complex workflows.
